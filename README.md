# CompostNYC: A Proximity-Based 3D Visualization

üóΩüå± Welcome!üìçüåé </br>
</br>
CompostNYC is an immersive 3D visualization of buildings within 400m (5 min walking) of a compost location in NYC. <br>


# Build Process

## Phase 1: Data Collection</br>
‚Ä¢ Obtain composite site location data from NYC OpenData. On CARTO, add data to the data warehouse > organization data. CARTO generates the schemas automatically and plots the data on the map. This is the first spatial layer.</br>

*Compost Locations:*
![compost_locations](https://github.com/swersk/compostNYC/assets/111617376/b6889b29-c2e5-46ce-9742-dc6d175005f5)


‚Ä¢ Obtain NYC building data via PLUTO from CARTO data warehouse > demo data.</br>

*Buildings in NYC:*
![building_locations](https://github.com/swersk/compostNYC/assets/111617376/2b52d846-9d65-4a4e-9056-128f731c58e4)

## Phase 2: Spatial Analyses</br>

‚Ä¢ Goal: Determine which buildings are within 400m (5min walking) of a compost bin.</br>
‚Ä¢ Create a buffer of 400m around each compost bin.</br>

*Buffer (400m) around each compost site:*
![buffer_zone](https://github.com/swersk/compostNYC/assets/111617376/7b60c35f-eff1-48b3-8038-800a87f5883d)

Write SQL commands to identify the buildings that are within 83m (1 block), 250m (3min walking), and 400m (5min walking). 

```
SELECT
    b.* -- Select all columns from building_locations
FROM
    carto-demo-data.demo_tables.manhattan_pluto_data b,
    carto-dw-ac-zp3r15zi.shared.CompostNYC c
WHERE
    ST_DWithin(b.geom, c.geom, 400);
```

*Buildings within 83m, 250m, and 400m of a compost bin:*

## Phase 3: Styling</br>

‚Ä¢ Buildings that are within 400m of a compost bin are colored green; else red.</br>

## Phase 4: Ship!
