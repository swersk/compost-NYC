# CompostNYC: A Proximity-Based 3D Visualization

🗽🌱 Welcome!📍🌎 </br>
</br>
CompostNYC is an immersive 3D visualization of buildings within 400m (5 min walking) of a compost location in NYC. <br>


# Build Process

## Phase 1: Data Collection</br>
• Obtain composite site location data from NYC OpenData. On CARTO, add data to the data warehouse > organization data. CARTO generates the schemas automatically and plots the data on the map. This is the first spatial layer.</br>

*Compost Locations:*

• Obtain NYC building data via PLUTO from CARTO data warehouse > demo data.</br>
*Buildings in NYC:*

## Phase 2: Spatial Analyses</br>

• Goal: Determine which buildings are within 400m (5min walking) of a compost bin.</br>
• Create a buffer of 400m around each compost bin.</br>

*Buffer (400m) around each compost site:*

## Phase 3: Styling</br>

• Buildings that are within 400m of a compost bin are colored green; else red.</br>

## Phase 4: Ship!
